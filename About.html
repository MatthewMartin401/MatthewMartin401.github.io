                    Hi, I'm Matthew Martin. I'm a Qualified Computer Games Design Graduate acheiving a BA. During this, I gained skills Coding in the Unreal Engine, 3D Modelling, Animation, Rigging, and Texturing. After graduating, I felt motivated to continue improving upon my skills, and decided to learn coding languages in my own time. I have recently attended a L4 Software Engineering Skills Bootcamp, where I learnt to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. During this, i used these skill to create a e-commerce website project using the React framework, which loaded its data from a SQL Database on a cloud.

                    This website was created by me to show some of the work i've made visally, as to focus on the finished result.
